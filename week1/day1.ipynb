Simply click in each \"cell\" with code in it, such as the cell immediately below this text, and hit Shift+Return to execute that cell. As you wish, you can add a cell with the + button in the toolbar, and print values of variables, or try out variations.  \n",

    "If you want to become a pro at Jupyter Lab, you can read their tutorial [here](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). But this isn't required for our course; just a good technique for hitting Shift + Return and enjoying the result!\n",

    "\n",
    "A final thought. While I've designed these notebooks to be educational, I've also tried to make them enjoyable. We'll do fun things like have LLMs tell jokes and argue with each other. But fundamentally, my goal is to teach skills you can apply in business. I'll explain business implications as we go, and it's worth keeping this in mind: as you build experience with models and techniques, think of ways you could put this into action at work today. Please do contact me if you'd like to discuss more or if you have ideas to bounce off me."

    "1. OpenAI takes a few minutes to register after you set up an account. If you receive an error about being over quota, try waiting a few minutes and try again.\n",
    "2. You'll need to set up billing and add the minimum amount of credit at this page [here](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/billing/overview). OpenAI requires a minimum of $5 to get started in the U.S. right now - this might be different for your region. You'll only need to use a fraction for this course. In my view, this is well worth the investment for your education and future projects - but if you have any concerns, you can skip this and watch me using OpenAI instead. In week 3 we will start to use free open-source models!\n",
    "3. Also, double check you have the right kind of API token with the right permissions. You should find it on [this webpage](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) and it should show with Permissions of \"All\". If not, try creating another key by:\n",
    "- Pressing \"Create new secret key\" on the top right\n",
    "- Select **Owned by:** you, **Project:** Default project, **Permissions:** All\n",
    "- Click Create secret key, and use that new key in the code and the `.env` file (it might take a few minutes to activate)\n",
    "- Do a Kernel >> Restart kernel, and execute the cells in this Jupyter lab starting at the top\n",
    "4. As a fallback, replace the line `openai = OpenAI()` with `openai = OpenAI(api_key=\"your-key-here\")` - while it's not recommended to hard code tokens in Jupyter lab, because then you can't share your lab with others, it's a workaround for now\n",
    "5. Contact me! Message me or email ed@edwarddonner.com and we will get this to work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any concerns about API costs? See my notes in the README - costs should be minimal, and you can control it at every point."
